# The Vision
Are you a city planner or a mobility operation? Ever wonder where people commute to from a part of a city? Ever wonder how they commuted?  Ever wonder what type of transportation mode they used? Wished all this information is in one place and can be viewed simultanously? Then Final Destination might be the pipeline you might be interested in. Final Destination is a multimodal commuter analytics pipeline that shows you where to, when and how people commute in New York City from any spot within New York City.   

# How to Use 
To use, simply just pick a starting location (zip code) and the date and time information.  The Tableau map interface will show you all the destinations people from the starting location traveled to. 

The color of the destination indicate the number of travelers to that said location. Intersted in more analytics about the people going to that destination, roll your mouse over the destination and see the break down of how people traveled to that said location. Information currently supported is mode breakdown, subscriber ratio, credit card payment ratio, distance, time and whether a cab was hailed.
